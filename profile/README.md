# 🏡 Daniel’s LocalOps – Brand, Roadmap, and Strategy

## 👋 Homepage Introduction

Welcome to **Daniel’s LocalOps** — a personal initiative to build sustainable home automation systems using Rust and embedded hardware.

I’m Daniel, a senior backend developer with 10 years of experience, now documenting my journey toward a more self-sufficient lifestyle. I started this with zero experience in Rust, embedded systems, or self-hosted infrastructure — everything here reflects my learning process.

Whether it’s a smart watering system or a DIY solar monitor, I’m exploring how tech can support independence, privacy, and resilience.

## 🌱 What You’ll Find Here

This site is a place for:

- 🛠️ **Project updates**: What I’m building, how it’s going, and what I’ve learned  
- ⚙️ **Tech stack breakdowns**: Tools, libraries, and hardware I’m using  
- 🔍 **Behind-the-scenes**: Setup, challenges, and progress logs  
- 🔄 **CI/CD experiments**: Automating builds and deployments for embedded Rust projects — all locally hosted  

I’m not writing tutorials — just sharing my process in a way that’s honest, practical, and hopefully helpful to others exploring similar paths.

## 🧭 Learning Roadmap

> This roadmap reflects my journey from the ground up. While I’ve worked professionally as a backend developer, I had no prior experience with Rust, microcontrollers, or local hosting when I began.

### Phase 1: Learn Rust Basics
- Complete Rustlings exercises  
- Build small CLI tools to understand ownership, borrowing, and error handling  

### Phase 1.5: Build Project Website in Rust
- Create a static site generator or use a Rust web framework  
- Host blog and documentation locally  

### Phase 2: Microcontroller Setup & Embedded Rust
- Choose a board (RP2040 recommended)  
- Blink an LED and read sensor input using Rust  
- Use probe-rs for flashing and debugging  

### Phase 3: Sensor Integration
- Connect and calibrate a soil moisture sensor  
- Read analog values and define watering thresholds  

### Phase 4: Actuator Control
- Use a relay or transistor to control a water pump  
- Automate watering based on sensor data  

### Phase 5: MQTT & Raspberry Pi Integration
- Set up Mosquitto broker locally  
- Use Rust MQTT client to publish/subscribe  
- Integrate with Raspberry Pi for dashboard  

### Phase 6: CI/CD Setup
- Automate builds and tests for Rust projects  
- Host pipeline locally for full control  

### Phase 7: Sustainability & Maintenance
- Monitor system health with local logging and alerts  
- Design for low power consumption and hardware longevity  
- Build self-repairing or fallback routines  
- Document how to maintain and expand the system without external dependencies

## 🏡 Home Sustainability Track

- 🌿 Indoor grow setup with automated lighting and watering  
- ♻️ Compost bin monitor using temperature and humidity sensors  
- 🌧️ Rainwater collection system with tank level tracking  
- ☀️ Solar power dashboard for local energy monitoring  
- 🥫 Food preservation tools (e.g., dehydrator automation, fermentation logs)  
- 🌱 Seasonal garden automation with zone-based watering

## 📆 Project Milestones

These milestones reflect my personal learning journey. Each step is spaced 30 days apart to accommodate a busy schedule and allow time for iteration.

- ✅ **By July 15**: Complete Rustlings and build first CLI tool  
- ✅ **By August 15**: Build project website in Rust with integrated blog  
- ✅ **By September 15**: Blink LED on RP2040 and read sensor input  
- ✅ **By October 15**: Automate watering system with soil sensor + pump  
- ✅ **By November 15**: Launch local dashboard on Raspberry Pi
