Welcome to Daniel’s LocalOps — where software meets soil. I’m Daniel, a senior backend developer with 10 years of experience, diving headfirst into embedded Rust, microcontrollers, and local-first automation. I’m building systems for self-sufficiency: smart watering setups, energy dashboards, and privacy-respecting infrastructure — all from scratch, with no prior experience in hardware or Rust. This channel documents my journey as I learn, build, and iterate. No tutorials. No fluff. Just honest logs, working prototypes, and the occasional bug hunt. If you’re into Rust, DIY automation, or the idea of hosting your own infrastructure, you’ll feel right at home. Subscribe to follow the builds, the breakdowns, and the breakthroughs.
