### 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Daniel** — a senior backend developer with 10 years of experience, now diving headfirst into:

- 🦀 Embedded **Rust**
- 🧠 Microcontrollers
- 🏡 Local-first automation

I’m building systems for **self-sufficiency**:  
💧 Smart watering setups  
⚡ Energy dashboards  
🔐 Privacy-respecting infrastructure  

All from scratch — no prior hardware or Rust experience. Just grit, curiosity, and a soldering iron.

---

### 📺 What This Is

This space documents my journey as I **learn, build, and iterate**.  
No tutorials. No fluff. Just:

- 🔧 Honest build logs  
- 🐞 Bug hunts and breakthroughs  
- 📦 Working prototypes

If you’re into **Rust**, **DIY automation**, or the idea of **hosting your own infrastructure**, you’ll feel right at home.
